	<p class="bodytext">In this segment we're going to talk about sales techniques. Right from the start let me say that we're not going to suggest that there is only one way to sell. There is no such thing as a fixed presentation. Out there on the selling floor you become a lot like the improvisational actor. By definition, improvisational actors are people who are given a subject or suggestion by the audience and then proceed to create a sketch or scene without any prepared script or plot. They simply wing it, as they say. Obviously because they've been doing improvisational theatre for some time they've developed routines and methods of handling some of the oddball suggestions that come from the audience.
	<br> 
	<br>
	Well, you've got a lot in common with those actors. Even though you know the product there's no set script. The customer is going to throw some oddball suggestions at you and you have to be ready to deal with whatever they come up with. However at the same time you have the opportunity to exert a great deal of control over the selling situation and one of the objectives of this program is to show you how to do exactly that. And the first step in showing you how to control the selling situation is to give you a different perspective on selling a perspective that will show you how to identify a prospects true buying motives and then to structure a sales presentation to take full advantage of this vital information. As you'll see once you know the customers buying motives you'll have little trouble controlling the direction and flow of the sale. Enough introduction, let's begin. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The first thing you must understand is that almost every automobile sale eventually becomes a classic negotiation. By definition, a negotiation is an activity in which parties are trying to satisfy their individual needs. As a salesperson your main objective is to persuade the customer that your product, in this case a Mercedes-Benz, satisfies their automotive needs better than any other automobile. At the same time you're trying to satisfy your need to earn a commission and turn a prospect into a source of repeat business and referrals. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The best and most positive type of negotiation is what we call the win-win. In this type of negotiation everyone leaves feeling that he or she has one the customer has the automobile he or she wants and you have the sale. You've both won because you both have the sense of having satisfied personal needs. Keep this definition in mind because it's fundamental to everything that follows. Now let's see how this effort to satisfy needs fits into the structure of the classic automobile negotiation.
	<br>
	<br>
	Traditionally when we talk about an automobile sale we're talking about a set of well-defined steps. Meet-and-greet, probing, and qualifying selling benefits, demonstrating, handling objections, closing delivery, and follow-up. 
	Let's look at each of these steps in more detail. With each prospect that walks into the showroom, you have but one chance to make a good first impression, and a lot of that first impression will be determined by your attitude, the expression on your face, and by the way you're dressed. Needless to say a pleasant expression and the professional appearance will go a long way toward creating a positive impression. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The objective of the meet greet step is to begin the process of establishing trust. As you well know this is an absolute must in our business and with some customers this may be one of the most difficult things to do. The reason is this: people who have been buying automobiles in the domestic market have been conditioned over the years to expect the worst from salespeople. Their experiences might range from salesmen who treated them without an out hostility, to someone who was ready to promise anything to get the sale. Because of the quality of our automobiles the tone of our advertising and our overall image most people expect to be treated differently in a Mercedes-Benz dealership. They assume that the quality of the automobile is also reflected in the people. So in general, the prospects who walk through the front door expect better treatment and it's up to you to confirm their expectations. </p>

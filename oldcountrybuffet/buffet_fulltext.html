	YOUR OTHER SHIFT DUTIES. 
	<br>
	<br>
	We will begin with your second shift duty: greeting and serving guests. 
	<br>
	<br>
	“Good evening! Find enough to eat today?”
	<br>
	<br>
	“Boy, I'll say.”
	<br>
	<br>
	“Well, that's great. Would you care for ham or beef?”
	<br>
	<br>
	“A little of both I think.”
	<br>
	<br>
	“Alright.”
	<br>
	<br>
	Making friendly conversations like this is a big part of greeting and serving guests. At other buffet style restaurants, guests often feel they're on their own. Once they've paid for the meal, no one pays much attention to them. At Old Country Buffet we work hard to make sure our guests never feel that way. As a carver, you spend a little more time with guests than team members. That means you have a great chance to make them feel welcome and appreciated. By greeting the guests warmly and holding brief conversations as you serve them, you say to our guests, “we're glad you're here.” 
	<br>
	<br>
	Let's take a closer look at greeting guests. Every conversation you hold with guests should begin something like this:
	<br>
	<br>
	“Good evening.” 
	<br>
	<br>
	Or:
	<br>
	<br>
	“Hi, how are you?”
	<br>
	<br>
	Once you've greeted the guest, start a brief conversation. Try asking a question the guests can answer in a sentence or two. You might ask something like this:
	<br>
	<br>
	“Is it still hot out there?”
	<br>
	<br>
	Or this:
	<br>
	<br>
	“Did you catch the game last night?” 
	<br>
	<br>
	Or this:
	<br>
	<br>
	“Have you tried the lasagna? That's my favorite.”
	<br>
	<br>
	Don't forget to hold quick conversations with our younger guests too. Children often play a big part in deciding which restaurant their parents visit. We want them to feel welcome and special here too, so start conversations with children by saying something like this:
	<br>
	<br>
	“What grade are you in at school?”
